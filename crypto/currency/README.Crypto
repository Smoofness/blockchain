Adjusted add_transaction to check if there is enough balance. 
A bit unsure of how each endpoint interacts with one another. Unsure how to proceed with other tasks. 

Attempted to make GUI, didn't work out. Couldn't figure out how to use tkinter. 

Added to mine block to add a transaction where the miner/current node gets 10.
